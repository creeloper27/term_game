# term_game

This is a terminal-based shooter game that can run on both linux and windows machines.

I'm trying to make the code as symple as possible by commenting everything, keeping the code on a single file and trying to use as few libraries as possible.

If you want to try it without the need of compiling you can download the Windows_Compiled and extract it.

For infos about the controls and other stuff look at the wiki
